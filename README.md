## Challenges faced

[ Prisma ](https://www.prisma.io/)

- Prisma is an ORM that contains tools such as Prisma Client and Prisma Migrate.
- I struggled to get the models right from the start and had to change them alot of times throughout.
- The relationships between the tables and the primary and foreign keys is not as straightforward as I think it would be.
